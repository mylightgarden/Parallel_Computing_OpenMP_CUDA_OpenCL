This repo includes 4 parallel programming projects:

1. CUDA Monte Carlo Simulation
2. Functional Decomposition
3. Numeric Integration with OpenMP Reduction
4. OpenCL and OpenGL Particle System

The performance results of comparing different numbers of parallel / cores are provided in the pdf documents. Please note that most of the results are based on running on my labtop that having an Intel i7 CPU.
